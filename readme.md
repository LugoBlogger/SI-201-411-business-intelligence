# SI 201 411 - Business Intelligence

This repository is for all notes that I have been made during 
"Business Intelligence" course in the Study Program of Information
Systems at Institut Teknologi Kalimantan. This course is more
inclined towards technical aspect of business intelligence, specifically
data visulization, and disucssing how to create a dashboard using code (not
a drag-and-drop application such as Power BI).

In the first two weeks, we start to understand the body of knowledge for
business intelligence. The explanation more focus on business intelligence
architecture, and where the part of it is a dashboard. Most of the weeks
during the course, we will mainly explore and learn how to create a visualization
using D3.js. All the materials are coming from (Meeks, 2018)

I cannot find a single textbook that that explores technical 
aspect of business intelligence by building a dashboard using
code. So, here I make a list of books in the reference 
that will be valuable for learning this course. For the cases in real life
applications, I will use (Sharda et al., 2024). This book
is a managerial persepctive and only gives us a bird's eye view.
