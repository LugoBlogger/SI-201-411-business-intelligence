You may use ChatGPT, but be careful that it may give you a false answer 
and sometimes it is hallucinated. The point of learning is to understand what you write. 
Without understanding your answer by yourself, this assignment is useless.

## Problem 1 (70 points)
In this problem, you have to do literature reviews related to a dashboard
by some IT companies. Choose two IT companies from the internet, and 
make a breakdown of its business intelligence architecture. You have to 
identify each component of its architecture using the diagram that you 
have learned during the course (see the slides).

Explain also the technology to build its dashboard (if it is applicable).
Do they use D3.js? or any other frameworks? Please describe your answers.

## Problem 2 (30 points)

Choose one graph from [The D3.js Graph Gallery](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/)
and understand how to create it using D3.js. Give a reason why do you choose
that graph for answering this problem. Can you simplify the code such 
that it is understandable for your own sake?
